cartoee
===================================

:code:`cartoee` is a simple Python package used for making publication quality
maps from `Earth Engine <https://earthengine.google.com/>`_ results using
`Cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/>`_ without having to
export results from Earth Engine.

This packages aims to do only one thing well: getting processing results from
Earth Engine into a publication quality mapping interface. :code:`cartoee`
simply gets results from Earth Engine and plots it with the correct geographic
projections leaving :code:`ee` and :code:`cartopy` to do more of the processing
and visualization.
